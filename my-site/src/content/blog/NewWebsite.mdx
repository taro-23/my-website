## New Website

I’m excited to announce the launch of my new website, built to provide a clearer, faster, and more user-friendly experience for anyone interested in sound design, sample packs, synth presets, and wavetable content.

The new site consolidates all product pages, demo audio, updates, and release notes into one streamlined platform. Whether you’re looking for percussion samples, wavetable collections, or specialized sound design tools, everything is now easier to browse and download.

### Key Improvements

- A clean, distraction-free layout for product pages
- Faster loading and optimized audio demos
- Clear categories for sample packs, wavetables, presets, and free products



What’s Next
I will continue updating the site with new releases, technical notes on sound design, and development logs for upcoming packs. More demo content and downloadable freebies will also be added regularly.  

Thank you for your support. I hope the new website makes it easier to explore and enjoy my work.
