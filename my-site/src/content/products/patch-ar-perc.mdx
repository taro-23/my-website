## Description
#### Semi realistic percussion sounds for Analog Rytm
This pack contains percussion patches using Analog Rytm's very flexible synthesis. Contains bongo, metal and wood percussion sounds.

Analog Rytm is a drum machine, but the internal machine has 2 VCOs + 1 VCF + 1 LFO like a normal analog synth, allowing you to design and create a variety of sounds. I used frequency modulation and other techniques to create semi-realistic percussion sounds and metallic sounds.
### Requirements
Analog Rytm MKI, Analog Rytm MKII
### Included
- 165 synth patches, 4kits/4Patterns
