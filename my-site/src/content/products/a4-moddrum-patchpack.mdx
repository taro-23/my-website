## Description
These Patches are Drum/Percussion, Bass, Lead, Pad, Metallic/Bell and SFX sounds. I made this pack aiming mainly for acoustic drum sounds.
This pack was created using all the features of A4. In particular, I think that it will be helpful when creating percussion sounds , gong sounds and snare sounds yourself.
### This pack can also be used with Analog Four MK2.
The difference in sound appears when you change the overdrive parameters. The main sound source is the self-oscillating sound of the filter, so there is no significant difference in sound between MK1 and MK2.
### Requirements
Analog Four MKI, Analog Four MKII, Analog Keys
