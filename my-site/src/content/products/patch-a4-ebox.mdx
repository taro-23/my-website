## Description
### Phaser, Distortion and Formant filters
This pack is a collection of effects patches routed in series with 4 Analog Four tracks.
It contains a phaser and a formant filter kit with four filters in series. The performance knobs are set so you don't have to bother with all four tracks.
How to use
### This pack can also be used with Analog Four MK2.
The difference in sound appears when you change the overdrive parameters. The main sound source is the self-oscillating sound of the filter, so there is no significant difference in sound between MK1 and MK2.
### Requirements
Analog Four MKI, Analog Four MKII, Analog Keys
### Included
- 1 Analog Four Project file
- 9 kits(Phaser, Formant Filter, Feedback Distortion)
