## Description
A collection of FM percussion sounds using LFOs. The collection includes electronic congas, tabla and other percussion sounds, as well as drum sounds inspired by the Elektron Machinedrum EFM machine.
### This pack can also be used with Analog Four MK2.
The difference in sound appears when you change the overdrive parameters. The main sound source is the self-oscillating sound of the filter, so there is no significant difference in sound between MK1 and MK2.
### Requirements
Analog Four MKI, Analog Four MKII, Analog Keys
