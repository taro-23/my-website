## Description
A collection of FM percussion sounds using LFOs. The collection includes electronic congas, tabla and other percussion sounds, as well as drum sounds inspired by the Elektron Machinedrum EFM machine.
### This pack can also be used with Analog Four MK2.
The difference in sound appears when you change the overdrive parameters. The main sound source is the self-oscillating sound of the filter, so there is no significant difference in sound between MK1 and MK2.
### Requirements
Analog Four MKI, Analog Four MKII, Analog Keys
### Included
- 245 synth patches
- BD-16,  Clap-13, Clave-3, Cowbell-4, Cymbal-9, Ride- 1, Hihat-6, Tambourine-4, Percussion-152+3, Rim shot-3, Snare-14, Noise-2, Zap-1
