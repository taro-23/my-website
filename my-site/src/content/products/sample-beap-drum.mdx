## Description
#### **One Shot Sample Pack + Project for Elektron Analog Rytm**
This collection of samples was created with BEAP(Max).

Beap is a modular synth that is included in Max. It has a large number of modules and you can add as many modules as your CPU power permits. The modules can be routed freely, allowing you to create cymbal and percussion sounds that are difficult to create with a normal synthesizer.
This sample pack contains a wide range of drum sounds, from semi-realistic conga sounds to 808-like analogue synth drum sounds, all using Beap's flexible synthesis.

### Included
- 210 samples, 24bit / 48kHz / Wav
    - BD -47, Snare -24, Clap -25, Cymbal -18, Hihat -10, Rim Shot -10, Tom -6, Percussion -16, Metal -8, Noise -35
    - Melodic Sounds-11
- 1 Analog Rytm Project File
