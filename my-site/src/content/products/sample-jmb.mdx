## Description
#### **Jomox MBase11 & Jomox MBrane11 Sample Pack**
The centerpiece of the JMB Sample Pack is the revered Jomox MBase 11 and Jomox MBrane 11 analog drum synths. These iconic hardware instruments have been meticulously sampled to capture their authentic analog warmth, punch, and character. Experience the rich, organic sounds of Analog drum machines, carefully preserved and ready to be integrated seamlessly into your tracks.

MBase11 has elaborately sampled heavy bass and kick sounds. MBase11's heavy bass sound and kick sound were sampled with precision. Provides a punchy sound to your tracks.
#### **Jomox MBrane 11 - Analog Membrane Modeling Sounds**
Two T-bridge oscillators create acoustic percussion sounds.  By combining this with metallic noise, various percussion and sound effect sounds can be created.
