## Description
### Classic drum machine sounds and fat kicks
Sound patches that imitate the sound of classic drum machines like the CR-78, 808 and 909.
### This pack can also be used with Analog Four MK2.
The difference in sound appears when you change the overdrive parameters. The main sound source is the self-oscillating sound of the filter, so there is no significant difference in sound between MK1 and MK2.
### Requirements
Analog Four MKI, Analog Four MKII, Analog Keys
### Included
- 64 synth patches
- BassDrum-4, Clap-1, Cowbell-3, Clave-1, Hihat/Cymbal-4, Clap-1,Conga-2,Guiro-1, Rim shot-4, Snare-6,  Tambourine-1, Tom-1, BD FAT-36
