## Description
#### **One Shot Sample Pack + Project for Elektron Analog Rytm**
D+A Sample Pack is a sound set that brings together the best of Dave Smith Instruments Tetra and Amazing Noises' Dark Synth.

This pack includes analog drum sounds created using Tetra's analog synth sounds as the core, as well as bells, 
metallic sounds, and percussion sounds created using the self-oscillating sounds of filters modulated with oscillators such as Prophet 5.
___
- Analog synth sounds from Dave Smith Instruments Tetra combined with digital sounds from Amazing Noises' Dark Synth
- Includes analog drum sounds created by Tetra, oscillator-modulated filter self-oscillation bells, metallic sounds, percussion sounds, and more.
- Dark Synth provides semi-realistic acoustic and synth sounds that have been analyzed and additively synthesized from real instrument sounds.
#### **Sequential(DSI) Tetra**
Tetra is a compact analogue synthesizer with 4 voices. It contains metal, bell and percussion sounds, making full use of the ability to modulate the oscillator sound into a filter self-oscillating sound, one of the characteristic sounds of the company's synthesizers. Of course, the classic kick and snare sounds are also included, using  thick oscillators.
#### **Amazing Noises Dark Synth**
Dark Synth is an additive synthesizer. It can draw up to 2048 overtones and can be used in unison, making it sound incredibly rich and beautiful.
Contains sounds copied from the overtone distribution values of acoustic instruments analysed by FFT into Dark Synth's overtone editor.
