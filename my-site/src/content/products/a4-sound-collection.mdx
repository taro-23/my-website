## Description
This is a collection of patch packs created with the Elektron Analog Four. It includes a wide variety of sounds, ranging from vintage synth drum sounds to semi-realistic drums, percussion, and bells, as well as synth sounds like pads and bass.
### This pack can also be used with Analog Four MK2.
The difference in sound appears when you change the overdrive parameters. The main sound source is the self-oscillating sound of the filter, so there is no significant difference in sound between MK1 and MK2.

Analog Four MKI, Analog Four MKII, Analog Keys
