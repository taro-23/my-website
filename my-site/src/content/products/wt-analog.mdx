## Description
#### Custom Wavetables
Analog Wavetable Pack is a custom Wavatable pack created from Analog Four and Analog Rytm sounds, precisely tuned to obtain cycle waveforms.
![vpswt](../../assets/img/Detail/wtbox/vps2_orig.gif)
- Analog Four wavetables are almost original sounds, as the complete periodic waveforms were recorded and then re-synthesised. It includes PWM, AM, oscillator sync, phaser and folding (external effects) using a wide range of sound processing options and flexible voice routing.
- Analog Rytm wavetables are created from single cycle waves from a specially tuned Dual VCO with LFO.
- Analog Wavetables with spectral digital effects
- Harmonic Wavetables mixing original and resynthesized waveforms
- Digital Wavetables(FM, Fold) with Analog effects(PWM, Phaser, Low Pass Filter)
