## Description
### Vowel Sounds
These patches are voice sounds simulating vowels(A,I,U,E,O).
### Formant
Formant is the peak of the spectrum of the human voice. On a synthesizer, the formant peak can be added to the oscillator and noise using the resonance of the filter to reproduce vowels.
### This pack can also be used with Analog Four MK2.
The difference in sound appears when you change the overdrive parameters. The main sound source is the self-oscillating sound of the filter, so there is no significant difference in sound between MK1 and MK2.
### Requirements
Analog Four MKI, Analog Four MKII, Analog Keys
### Included
- 39 synth patches
- template voice sounds-5, Various voice sounds[Bass, Lead, Pad]-34
